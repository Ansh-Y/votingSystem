RUNNING THE VOTING SYSTEM APPLICATION
------------------------------------

I've configured the application to run both frontend and backend on the same system without port conflicts:
- Frontend (React): Running on port 3000
- Backend (Node.js): Running on port 5000

Follow these steps to run the application:

1. First, make sure your MySQL database is properly set up:
   - If you haven't set up the database yet, follow the instructions in database_setup_instructions.txt

2. Start the backend server:
   ```
   cd backend
   npm run dev
   ```
   You should see: "Server running on http://localhost:5000"

3. In a new terminal window, start the frontend:
   ```
   cd C:\Users\lenovo\voting-system
   npm start
   ```
   This will automatically open http://localhost:3000 in your browser

4. Test the application with these credentials:
   - Admin: admin@example.com / Admin123
   - Voter: voter1@example.com / Voter123
   - Candidate: candidate1@example.com / Candidate123

TROUBLESHOOTING
--------------

If you encounter errors:

1. Database connection issues:
   - Check that your MySQL server is running
   - Verify the database credentials in backend/.env
   - Make sure the database tables are created properly

2. "Cannot find module" errors:
   - Run `npm install` in both the root directory and backend directory

3. Port conflicts:
   - If port 3000 is in use, React will automatically suggest using another port (like 3001)
   - If port 5000 is in use, you can change it in backend/.env

4. API connection errors:
   - Make sure both servers are running
   - Check that src/services/api.js has the correct backend URL (http://localhost:5000/api)

5. Login errors:
   - Make sure the users table was created with an 'email' column
   - Verify the test user accounts were inserted correctly
